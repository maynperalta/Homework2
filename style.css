/* This CSS is for the FontAwesome icons in the contact page. The icons were made possible through using a Font Awesome cdn CSS stylesheet. However, even cutting and pasting the code directly from the source as-is resulted in a distorted appearance and visual problems when the mouse cursor hovers over the icons. This was remedied by additional CSS such as an adjustment to the width, a text decoration of none (which eliminated an underline hover effect), and a color set to white (which ensured the icon color remained white. Otherwise, it would invert and change the appearance of the icon). Each individual icon also has it's own brand-specific background color. These icons link to my personal social media pages for the corresponding sites. They also open in a new tab in order to keep the user's place on this page. */
