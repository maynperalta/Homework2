<!-- Here is the beginning of the HTML code. This includes the language.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<!--Here is the head of the HTML. This has what character set I used fot the code. I went with UTF-8 which is widely used and I've never had a problem with it. Also, here lies our viewport metadata which turns off shrink to fit in order to avoid problems with reponsiveness. This assignment requires us to use Bootstrap, so I've included the Bootstrap CDN link. I have also linked a second stylesheet for further CSS sylization of the code. The title of the webpage is also contained in the head. This is the title that will appear in the webpage tab of the browser. I've used semantic HTML for the head, metadata, links, and title.-->

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./style.css">
    <title>About Me</title>
</head>

<!--This is where the body of the HTML code begins. This is all of the data that will appear on the website itself. We'll start with the Navbar. I've used Semantic HTML to mark the body of the entire document, and to also designate what code is part of the navbar, and an unordered list with some list tags for the links themselves. Originally, I wanted to avoid all of the list tags in order to present less cluttered HTML code, but it led to multiple appearance and functionality complications. This navbar was taken from the components section of the Getbootstrap site. I modified it because originally, it was much lighter and all of the links were bunched up next to my name (or the name of the brand had this been for a company). Here we have my name on the left side of the navbar and links to the home/about page, portfolio, and contact pages on the right. When the viewport is shrunk, or this page is viewed on a mobile phone, the navbar collapses into a hamburger menu which will display the links when clicked. The links will also highlight with a hover effect when the mouse cursor is over them with the active link being the brightest of the three. On this page, the "Home" link is active which would bring a view back to the index.html page. -->

<body>
    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark">
        <span class="navbar-brand mb-0 h1">Maynard Peralta</span>
        <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarNav" aria-controls="navbarNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
          <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
        </button>
        <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
          <ul class="navbar-nav ml-auto">
            <li class="nav-item active">
              <a class="nav-link" href="index.html">Home<span class="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="nav-link" href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="nav-link" href="contact.html">Contact</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </nav>

<!--After the navbar, is the container of the code. This is where I started using the bootstrap grid system on this page. The container is reponsive, so when the viewport is changed, the layout will be arranged to present in an aesthetically pleasing fashion. The container starts with a row and a full length column for the header. I used a full length column in order to make a style choice of an underline to extend the full width of the container. This was obtained by making a thick border at the bottom of the column.-->

    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <h1>About Me</h1>
            </div>

<!--I used another row here to place my picture and bio information. I wanted a picture that would have the text wrap around it in a responsive fashion. I was able to accomplish this by using a 4-column sub-column nested into a full 12-column column. I also added text wrap and float-left classes to help obtain this appearance. Bootstrap classes have a lot of their own properties, so it took some tweaking to line everything up the way I wanted. The headshot image is held with the semantic img tag and given the class "img-fluid" which allows it to respond to the screen size of the viewport. For me, this was the trickiest part of the assignment.-->     

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-12 text-wrap">
            <div class="col-md-4 float-left">
            <img src="./assets/Headshot.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="headshot">
            </div>
              <p>Hello, everybody. Welcome to my page. My name is Maynard Peralta. I was born in Pueblo, Colorado and moved to the Denver area in 2000. I spent a lot of time working with computers while I was a student and am hoping to get back into the technology field. I'm currently a railroad employee who has decided that now is a good time to make use of my brain and learn how to code. It's pretty exciting, and not to blow my own horn or anything, but I'm picking it up a lot better than I thought I would. So, hopefully I can keep this same pace of learning. Here you will see my first attempts at putting together a website. I have included a link to a  portfolio, as well as a page for contacting me and connecting with me via social media. I'm open to feedback since I believe that will only help me improve. Have a nice day!
              </p>

<!--At the bottom of the page is the footer, which is fixed to the bottom of the viewport through CSS. At the bottom of the body of the code are the script links for jQuery and Javascript. These scripts allow the navbar to function when in a collapsed state.-->
