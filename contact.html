<!--Here is the head of the HTML. This has what character set I used fot the code. I went with UTF-8 which is widely used and I've never had a problem with it. Also, here lies our viewport metadata which turns off shrink to fit in order to avoid problems with reponsiveness. This assignment requires us to use Bootstrap, so I've included the Bootstrap CDN link. I have also linked a second stylesheet for further CSS sylization of the code. Also, this page is a bit different because I used some FontAwesome icons. In order to get those icons to appear, I have another link to a FontAwesome CDN stylesheet. The title of the webpage is also contained in the head. This is the title that will appear in the webpage tab of the browser. I've used semantic HTML for the head, metadata, links, and title.-->

<!--This is where the body of the HTML code begins. This is all of the data that will appear on the website itself. We'll start with the Navbar. I've used Semantic HTML to mark the body of the entire document, and to also designate what code is part of the navbar, and an unordered list with some list tags for the links themselves. Originally, I wanted to avoid all of the list tags in order to present less cluttered HTML code, but it led to multiple appearance and functionality complications. This navbar was taken from the components section of the Getbootstrap site. I modified it because originally, it was much lighter and all of the links were bunched up next to my name (or the name of the brand had this been for a company). Here we have my name on the left side of the navbar and links to the home/about page, portfolio, and contact pages on the right. When the viewport is shrunk, or this page is viewed on a mobile phone, the navbar collapses into a hamburger menu which will expand and display the links when clicked. The links will also highlight with a hover effect when the mouse cursor is over them with the active link being the brightest of the three. On this page, the "Contact" link is active. -->

<body>
    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark">
        <span class="navbar-brand mb-0 h1">Maynard Peralta</span>
        <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarNav" aria-controls="navbarNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
          <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
        </button>
        <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
          <ul class="navbar-nav ml-auto">
            <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="nav-link" href="index.html">Home</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="nav-link" href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item active">

            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </nav>

<!--After the navbar, is the container of the code. This is where I started using the bootstrap grid system on this page. The container is reponsive, so when the viewport is changed, the layout will be arranged to present in an aesthetically pleasing fashion. The container starts with a row and a full length column for the header. I used a full length column in order to make a style choice of an underline to extend the full width of the container. This was obtained by making a thick border at the bottom of the column.-->

  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h1>Contact</h1>
      </div>
    </div>

<!--This part of the container is a mockup of a form in order to send me a message. Unfortunately, we haven't learned the intricacies of creating a functional form just yet, so the form doesn't send information anywhere. The submit button is a non-functional button from the getbootstrap components button list using the semantic HTML of "button". The actual "submit" button that exsists within the form section of the components takes the user to a dead page, resulting in being pulled away from the pages that are a part of this assignment. The form uses semantic HTML for the form itself, as well as labels, inputs, small text, and textarea.-->

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <form action="/action_page.php">

<!--After the form section of the container on this page, I have a smaller header using h4 semantic HTML in order to give users links to my social media accounts. These icons are in the row below the h4 header and were obtained using Font Awesome icons which required a separate stylesheet in order to appear correctly. This wasn't without its own headache however. The Font Awesome icons didn't behave as presented even with the code being cut and pasted directly from the source site. I had to further style the CSS in order to get them to respond and appear correctly. For example, initially the hover effect inverted the icon colors and presented a thick underline to the icons themselves. In addition to that, the width of the icons resulted in them being distorted upon initial viewing. The links in these icons take you directly to my personal social media accounts/sites.-->
